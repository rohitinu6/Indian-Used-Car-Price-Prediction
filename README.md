# Indian Used Car Price Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts the price of used cars in India based on various factors such as brand, model, year, fuel type, transmission, mileage, and more. The aim is to help buyers and sellers estimate fair market prices using machine learning techniques.

## 🚀 Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand pricing trends
- Feature selection and engineering
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Model deployment for real-world predictions

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset consists of used car listings with attributes such as:

- **Car Brand & Model**
- **Manufacturing Year**
- **Fuel Type** (Petrol, Diesel, CNG, Electric, etc.)
- **Transmission Type** (Manual, Automatic)
- **Mileage & Engine Capacity**
- **Owner Type** (First, Second, Third Owner)
- **Selling Price** (Target variable)

## 💊 Machine Learning Models Used

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor

## 🔥 Results

The models are evaluated based on RMSE, MAE, and R-squared values. Random Forest and XGBoost provide the best predictions for used car prices.
